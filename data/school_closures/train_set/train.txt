ive been angry about the way user user handling schools #covidseattle huge burden placed on kidsw medically vulnerable family or are medically vulnerable themselves miss school or risk infecting those they love user user #covid #closetheschools
why are we closing schools after a diagnosis of #covid surely by then the proverbial horse has bolted and they may have infected other students or teachers #covidaus #closetheschools
user wont close because parents cant afford to lose working hours or will struggle to find childcare and some students eat their main meals at school the system is broken and ultimately there may be some serious consequences down the road #covid #closetheschools
user please parents speak up call your board of education your superintendent your voices are the only voices that matter to the decision makers recommended distancing when possibleis not an answer to how schools will keep everyone safe #notmykid #notmychild
